#include <iostream>
//need to break down issue to small funcion. such as if we need to check if a char is a digit or not, we can write a new function (bool isDigit(char c)) to check sperately instead of writing it onto the function
//need to make comment about what you are trying to do
//function inside the class does not need to be writen on the top of the class in order to use it
//need to write/print some log to help expite the debug
//in problem #15 i used hash map algorithm which is a bad algorithm because it needs to deal with lots of coner cases. it took me 3 day to solve this problem. if i used the two pointer to solve this problem, i could have save lots of energy and time!! so choose the correct algorithm is very important

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // insert code here...
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
}
